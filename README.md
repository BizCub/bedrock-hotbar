## Usage
The mod currently has a settings menu that can be used if you install Cloth Config and ModMenu for Fabric. In the settings window, you can change the hotbar offset, and this can also be done by changing the value in the config file. Since version 1.1, the mod renders the bottom of the texture of the selected item, which allows it to be used with resource packs that change the hotbar
