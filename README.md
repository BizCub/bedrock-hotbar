## Description

## Usage
The mod doesn't have any settings yet, so to make the mod work you just need to install it in the mods folder.

## This mod is not fully ready
* I plan to add the ability to change the hotbar offset value.
* I already know the following problem. The mod stretches the item selection texture so that it does not look cut off at the bottom as it does now. Therefore, resource packs that change the GUI textures will most likely display incorrectly, but I added a new modified item selection texture that will display correctly. For this texture to be applied, you need to use the Fabric API for Fabric 1.20.2+.
